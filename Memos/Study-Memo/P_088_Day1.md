## Further thoughts about the story of goat/car

The story could be modelled in the following way:

*The participant and the host are involved in a zero-sum game. They are now at the stage when the participant has made his choice (door A) and the host is to open a door behind which there is a goat.*

Note that if the car is behind door B, then the host can only open door C; If the car is behind door C, then the host can only open door B. Therefore, the strategy of the host is determined by the probability $p$ that he opens door C when the car is behind door A.

The strategy of the participant can be represented as $(q, r)$, where
$$
q=P(\text{Choose door A if host opens door B})\\
r=P(\text{Choose door A if host opens door C})
$$
Suppose that the rewards of the car and the goat are $a, b$, respectively, where $a>b$. Then the expected reward of the participant is
$$
W(p, q, r)=\frac{1-q}3+\frac{1-r}3+\frac13\left[(1-p)q+pr\right]
$$
and the reward of the host is $-W(p, q, r)$. For the host, the Nash equilibrium satisfies one of the following cases:

- $$
  q=r\qquad 0<p<1
  $$

- $$
  p=1\qquad q>r
  $$

- $$
  p=0\qquad q<r
  $$

Note that
$$
W(1, q, r)=\frac{2-q}3
$$
So the participant should choose $q=0$, contradicting $q>r$; In the same way, the case where $q=0$ is impossible.

We have
$$
W(p, q, r)=\frac{-p}3 q+\frac{p-1}3r+\frac23
$$
$0<p<1$, so $q=r=0$ for the Nash equilibrium.

Therefore, **the participant should never have door A as a final choice**.

Now we calculate the possibility that the participant wins the car if the host opens door B. We have
$$
P(\text{Host opens door C}|\text{Car behind door A})=p\\
P(\text{Host opens door C}|\text{Car behind door B})=0\\
P(\text{Host opens door C}|\text{Car behind door C})=1
$$
With Bayes' theorem,
$$
P(\text{Car behind door B}|\text{Host opens door C})=\frac{1\cdot\frac13}{p\cdot\frac13+0\cdot\frac13+1\cdot\frac13}=\frac1{1+p}
$$
The probability depends on $p$. Interesting!
